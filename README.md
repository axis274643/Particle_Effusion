Particle simulation bounce

It started as what was supposed to be an infection game but turned out to become a particle simulator and then some strange game thing I have no idea

Don't worry, I actually separated the different objects into different classes this time. Sort of. At least it's not all in one class. There's improvement.

Actually, I'm not really sure what happened here, sorry. What I do know is that I somehow managed to convert quantitative data into a SELF-UPDATING GRAPH!!! COOL!!!

Actually, whenever I'm able to code ideas in my mind into reality it's really cool. That's probably what I like about coding. Just like what I like about drawing. Or writing. Or any other form of ing.

Yeah that last update was because I forgot to do double returns again oops
